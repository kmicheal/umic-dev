Install docker on personal Laptop;
Develop minimalistic 'Tracked-Container' systems - containers where every file is checksumed
- metadata(file_name, md5/sha, timestamp, last_modified_timestamp) stored in the container in a file ready to be read by an object-store such as Redis, or metadat exported on the fly to a Redis db

Plan is for this metadata to be available for each docker process(pipeline/setup)
