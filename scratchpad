Configuration of Pipelines

Using JSON, create collections of resources from which a pipeline can be built by a the configuration script.
* Some of the end-points are PLACEHOLDERS == variable
So the pipeline is created and places for the variables are known; at every step there a separate engine that retrieves the value
of that variable and plugs it into where it supposed to go.

Something like this below;
*on top of it could be a token for whenever a pipeline is created from the pool*
*or whenever the server tries to access this resource/pool, it should do so with token that identifies it*
*tokens are served by the setup/configuration manager and correspond to the details(project,study, etc) of the *
